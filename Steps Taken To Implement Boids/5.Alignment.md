The third and final rule we have to implement is the rule of alignment:
-  Boids must steer towards the average heading of local flockmates

By now you might be noticing a pattern, in our general Boid setup, we assign a:
1. Alignment Radius
Then we:
2. create a new PVector, target,
3. Loop through all the Boids, increasing our coutner for only those in the Alignment Radius and add the velocity of the Boids to target
4. Check if any Boids exists in the current Boids alignment radius
5. divide the target (all the velocitys of all the other Boids in the radius in a x,y format), over the amount of Boids
6. Set the magnitude to maxSpeed
7. Make a PVector force = the subtraction of velocity from target (target - velocity)
8. limit the force by maxForce
9. Multiply the force by your alignmentCoefficient
10. Then add the force to the acceleration
11. Lastly add the calling of the Alignment function to the update function

Finally, Done, now our Boids simply float around screen, seemless forming packs until they become close enough to somewaht collide with another pack, merging and swapping the Boids!

From here, there are a couple of modifications that I would like to further implement, these include:
- Slider Variables for all my seperated Coefficients, MaxValues, & Radius's, (Hence why we broke up all the variables)
- A Predator vs Prey Game
- General Placeable obstacles the Boids have to avoid.
